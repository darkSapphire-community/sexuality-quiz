# Sexuality Quiz
A (hopefully) crowd-developed quiz to help people discover, confirm or otherwise explore their sexuality.
The idea is essentially a website where people can answer a handful of questions and get a variety of details about what their responses say about their sexuality (think lists of labels, 2d graphs, links to more info). Once users have answered the minimum questions, they should have the choice to continue answering more questions to improve the accuracy of results.
I have decided the website should be a static site which does not collect any data about peoples responses or results and does not send responses to a server to be dealt with there, all processing should be kept on the users machine.

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute to this project, good on you!
There's two main ways you can contribute, either you can contribute to the website directly (i.e. work on the html/css or js sections) or if you would prefer (or don't have any web-development knowledge) you can focus on creating questions.

The intention of this project is for the questions to be contributed (and discussed) by as many people as possible to maximise the applicability of the questions.

## How to Use
Once the project has reached a useable stage I intend to publish the site and hence the latest public version will be easily viewed/used. Until then you will have to either clone this repo (or download as zip and then unzip if you don't have git) and open the index.html file with a modern web-browser of choice.

## Roadmap
Here is the rough plan of development in order:
1. Setup basic website layout and formatting *-complete*
2. Define specification for how questions are defined and what values are given to answers to be later used in analysis. *-complete*
3. Implement basic quiz to ask base questions.*-complete*
4. Implement meaningful and diverse analysis of the results.
5. Enable users to answer more questions.
